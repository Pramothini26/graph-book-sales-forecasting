# 📚 Graph-Based Forecasting of Book Sales

This project explores the use of graph-based techniques and machine learning to predict book sales. It applies centrality analysis to identify key features influencing sales and utilizes a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for forecasting.

## 📌 Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib
Feature Engineering: Encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, scaling numerical features
Graph-Based Analysis: Degree centrality, closeness, betweenness, eigenvector, Katz, and harmonic centrality
Machine Learning Models: Naïve Bayes, Random Forest Regressor
Graph Neural Network: GCN model trained for sales prediction
Model Evaluation: Mean Squared Error (MSE), R-squared score

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, NetworkX, TensorFlow, Seaborn, Matplotlib
Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook
